# Versioning

Meerkat DSA roughly uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), but it is
not entirely clear what constitutes a "breaking change" for something other than

In the face of this ambiguity, Meerkat DSA takes a somewhat liberal approach to
versioning, in part to avoid scaring off new users with repeated major version
increments.
