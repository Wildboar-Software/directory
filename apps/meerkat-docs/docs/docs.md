# How to use this documentation

This documentation is meant to be read in the order that the documents are
presented on the left sidebar.

This documentation assumes that you have a working understanding of the X.500
specifications. If you do not, you can find an index of the X.500 specifications
[here](./specs.md#x500-specifications). There is no point in re-iterating what
you could already learn by reading the specifications or other fine tutorials
out there, so this documentation is primarily meant to discuss the aspects of
Meerkat DSA that are specific to Meerkat DSA. If you want to learn more about
X.500 directory systems quickly, David Chadwick's free, online book
[Understanding X.500 - The Directory](http://sec.cs.kent.ac.uk/x500book/) is
about the quickest way it can be done.

Wherever this documentation refers to the
"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol," or "LDAP," the protocol described in
[IETF RFC 4510](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4510)
(LDAP version 3) is being referenced. Older versions of LDAP are not supported
by Meerkat DSA and never will be.
