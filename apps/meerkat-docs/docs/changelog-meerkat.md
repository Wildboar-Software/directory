  authentication. It is also secure against CSRF attacks.
- Fixed a bug with parsing attribute certificates.
- Fixed hidden LDAP entries that have non-LDAP attribute types in RDNs.
- Fixed display of dates and times.
- Fix bug with Trust Anchor List file decoding (not reading a `ContentInfo`).
- Search Aliases procedure used the DSA's name in the chaining arguments
  originator field. (Not a security vulnerability, though, since the association
  _was_ used for AC decisions.)
- Fix bug where entry could be created without required attribute by merely
  providing the attribute with no values.

### Migration

- `MEERKAT_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_AUTH` no longer controls `rejectUnauthorized`. This
  was a security bug. In fact, this environment variable is no longer used
  entirely. `MEERKAT_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENTS` controls mTLS. If set to
  `1`, mTLS is enforced.
- `MEERKAT_SIGNING_KEY` has been renamed to `MEERKAT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`
- `MEERKAT_SIGNING_CERT_CHAIN` has been renamed to `MEERKAT_SIGNING_CERTS_CHAIN_FILE`
- Removed `DANGEROUSLY` from `ENABLE_DSP` and `ENABLE_DOP`
  - Just use the `ENABLE_DSP` and `ENABLE_DOP` environment variables to enable
    DSP and DOP, respectively.
