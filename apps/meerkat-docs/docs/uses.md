# Uses

With only the X.500 schema in place, Meerkat DSA is generally only useful as
an identity store (which could be used by an OpenID connect, Auth0, or SAML
IDaaS), or it could be used as a sort of address book, yellow pages, or a CRM.

However, in the very near future, there will be a LOT more pre-installed schema,
relating to these use cases:

- DNS servers
- Kerberos
- GPG key servers
- Object identifier registries
- Docker registries
- DHCP servers
- Torrent trackers
- NTP server lists
- TOR node lists
- CRL servers
- OCSP responders
- And much more
