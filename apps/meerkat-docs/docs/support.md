# Support

If you believe you have found an issue, please report it on our
[GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Wildboar-Software/directory/issues).
**UNLESS** it is a security vulnerability, in which case, view the
[security policy](https://github.com/Wildboar-Software/directory/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md).

This is an open-source software project, so if you know how to program in
TypeScript or JavaScript, you could
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/Wildboar-Software/directory/pulls)
in GitHub that fixes it.

If you are interested in receiving support in creating and managing schema,
replication, operational bindings, security, and other, consider getting
[professional support](mailto:jonathan.wilbur@wildboarsoftware.com).
