/**
 * @summary Keep a subset of a tree of entries by their database ID
 * @description
 *
 * This function takes a subtree of vertices and returns a new subtree of
 * vertices whose members are exclusively those vertices whose IDs are present
 * in the `idsToKeep` set, with the exception of the case where the inclusion of
 * the root of the DIT is necessary to include two or more subordinates which
 * are themselves included by this selection.
 *
 * NOTE: This was made for producing the `family-information` attribute, which
 * is precisely such a subtree of entries.
 *
 * @param dit The root of some subset of the DIT
 * @param idsToKeep The set of database IDs of entries to keep from the DIT
 *  given by the `dit` parameter
 * @param familySelect The set of string-formatted dot-delimited object
 *  identifiers of the object classes selected by the `familySelect`, or `null`
 *  if there is no such selection
 * @param depth The depth of the current recursion
 * @returns
 *
 * @function
