/**
 * @summary Check matching use in a search filter
 * @description
 *
 * This function is a stub that currently does nothing. In spirit, its
 * intention is to check matching rule use according to the procedure described
 * in [ITU Recommendation X.511 (2019)](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.511/en),
 * Section 15.4, but Meerkat DSA does not support any matching restrictions
 * currently, so this step could never be performed correctly. Meerkat DSA, as
 * such, will simply not enforce matching use restrictions.
 *
 * @returns An object containing information about what problem was encountered
 *  and with what attribute types
 *
 * @function
