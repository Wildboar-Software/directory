/**
 * @summary Converts a relative distinguished name and converts it to a JSON-format
 * @description
 *
 * This function takes a relative distinguished name and converts it to a JSON
 * format that can be stored in a JSON column of a relational database.
 *
 * Note that there is no specification as to how relative distinguished names
 * are stored in the database in Meerkat DSA. Every RDN so encoded is simply
 * stored as an object whose keys are attribute types (dot-delimited object
 * identifier strings, or human-friendly names) and whose values are the
 * string forms of the values as used by LDAP, possibly using the
 * hex-encoded values as specified in IETF RFC 4514.
 *
 * @param rdn The relative distinguished name to be converted to JSON
 * @returns The JSON-encoded relative distinguished name
 *
