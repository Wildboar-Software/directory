# Advice

- It is recommended that administrators prevent subentries from being read
  from non-administrative users entirely, especially access control
  information. It is possible to misconfigure access controls, and if users
  have the ability to read access control information, it makes it easier for
  nefarious users to discover errors in access controls that they can exploit.
