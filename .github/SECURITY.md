# Security Policy

Do not disclose security vulnerabilities on the GitHub issues page. Disclose
them in private to Jonathan M. Wilbur <jonathan.wilbur@wildboarsoftware.com>
first. They will be publicized and you will be given credit for discovering them
where credit is due once the vulnerabilities are fixed.
