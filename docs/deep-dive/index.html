multiple levels of complexity, and more succinctly than competing textual works,
with the added benefit of modern analogies.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary<a class="hash-link" href="#executive-summary" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The X.500 directory is a technology for producing a global, distributed database
(although it can be used exclusively privately as well). It is &quot;distributed&quot; in
the sense that the data can be split across a nearly infinite number of
independent servers.</p><p>The way that data is represented in an X.500 directory lends itself to great
flexibility. An X.500 directory has features that make it like a time-series
database, a graph database, a document-oriented database, and a relational
database, all in one. It is designed primarily to store information about
people and organizations, but it can store any kind of data.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-it-solves">The Problem It Solves<a class="hash-link" href="#the-problem-it-solves" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Databases already exist, and they already have access controls, sharding,
authentication, integrity at rest, and so on. However, many organizations still
feel the need to put a REST API between end users and the database, which
demonstrates some fundamental shortcoming of existing solutions. Existing
solutions fall short in these respects, in which X.500 directories excel:</p><ol><li><strong>Standardized implementations with expectations of interoperability.</strong> X.500
is a series of standards. Implementations of X.500 directories are generally
interoperable, if well-constructed. There is no &quot;MySQL standard&quot; or &quot;Postgres
standard&quot; where you could implement your own alternative and expect future
compatibility with all other implementations. Abundance of implementations
means more options, better security, and a better ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Advanced access controls.</strong> In many databases, access controls can
constrain who has access to particular collections, documents, columns,
tables, and so on, but X.500 directories can regulate specific values, use
groups as layer of indirection, and regulate complex selections of the data.</li><li><strong>Designed to be split across domains of trust.</strong> Unlike database sharding,
X.500 directories are designed to confederate data across the
organizational boundary. Organizations can share their data, and even let
others modify it, but control who, how, when, and so on.</li><li><strong>Directly usable by end users.</strong> Traditional databases often store or
present data in a format that is not directly usable by end users. For this
reason, custom REST APIs and web apps are created to convert a
mess of relational tables into composed, meaningful &quot;objects&quot; representing
real world things. In X.500 directories, the data is already stored in this
manner: X.500 directories model data as real world things, and they are
browseable by human-friendly names like <code>CN=Jonathan M. Wilbur</code> rather than
UUIDs or serial numbers. You do not need to re-invent the wheel when you
already have a Porsche waiting for you.</li></ol><p>There are a few other benefits that are simply too technical for an executive
summary, but the above should be sufficient.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-future">The Future<a class="hash-link" href="#the-future" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The X.500 specifications were conceived in the late 1980s by the
International Telecommunications Union with the intent of creating a sort of
&quot;distributed, global phonebook,&quot; and, admittedly, they had much more traction
back then. However, if you research why the enthusiasm waned, you&#x27;ll find that
much of it is for reasons that are no longer applicable. X.500 directories are
thought of as &quot;legacy&quot; mistakenly: I believe they are the <em>future</em>. There are
technologies that died off because they are objectively inferior, such as
floppy disks, and there are those that were dormant for a long time simply
because they were invented before their time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-executive-summaries">Other Executive Summaries<a class="hash-link" href="#other-executive-summaries" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In addition to the above summary, other executive summaries of X.500 directory
services can be found in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.500/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITU Recommendation X.500 (2019)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1308.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IETF RFC 1308</a></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="users-deep-dive">User&#x27;s Deep Dive<a class="hash-link" href="#users-deep-dive" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The X.500 specifications are so rich in features that it can seem difficult to
break into it. This is a brief explanation of X.500 concepts for a user to
meaningfully use an X.500 directory.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="object-identifiers">Object Identifiers<a class="hash-link" href="#object-identifiers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>X.500 directories use object identifiers to identify almost everything, so
understanding what they are is important. If you finish reading this section
understanding nothing else, understand that <em>object identifiers are
globally-unique, numeric identifiers.</em></p><p>Object identifiers are composed of an ordered sequence of non-negative integers,
such as <code>2.5.4.3</code>. Each number in this list, called an <em>arc</em>, identifies
<em>something</em>. Arcs can be associated with a textual identifier, called a
<em>descriptor</em>, but these are optional and only serve to enhance readability.</p><p>The first number is the root arc, which can have the values <code>0</code>,
<code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>, exclusively. Each root arc is associated with and self-assigned to
one of three international standards organizations. These organizations define
object identifier arcs beneath the roots, which may be granted / delegated to
other organizations; these secondhand organizations may then grant arcs beneath
theirs to other organizations, recursively.</p><p>There is no universal process for &quot;registering&quot; an object identifier. If you or
your organization define an object identifier, you just simply <em>publish
what it means somewhere</em>. You can obtain an object identifier arc of your own
by registering with certain organizations. The Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA), gives away free object identifier arcs under <code>1.3.6.1.4.1</code>,
which it calls &quot;Private Enterprise Numbers.&quot; The Private Enterprise Number for
Wildboar Software is <code>56490</code>, meaning that the object identifier is
<code>1.3.6.1.4.1.56490</code>. This means that Wildboar Software is free to define all
object identifiers that start with <code>1.3.6.1.4.1.56490</code>.</p><p>With this out of the way, we can go over how an X.500 directory presents its
information.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="information-model">Information Model<a class="hash-link" href="#information-model" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="entries-and-attributes">Entries and Attributes<a class="hash-link" href="#entries-and-attributes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Directories represent information as <em>entries</em>. Entries represent real-world
objects, such as a person, organization, device, etc. Entries are represented
like documents in a document-oriented database, or a row in a relational
database or spreadsheet.</p><p>Entries are composed of <em>attributes</em>, which represent aspects of the real-world
object. If the entry represents a person, it might have a &quot;first name&quot;
attribute; if the entry represents a device, it might have a &quot;serial number&quot;
attribute; if the entry represents an organization, it might have a
&quot;phone number&quot; attribute. Attributes are like the columns in a relational
database or spreadsheet, or like the fields of a document in a document-oriented
database. Attributes are identified by an <em>attribute type</em>, which is a
globally-unique, numeric identifier. As a user of the X.500 directory, you do
not need to know or memorize these identifiers: it is expected that whatever
tool you use to browse the X.500 directory will translate these object
identifiers into human-friendly names, such as &quot;First Name&quot; or &quot;Serial Number.&quot;
Object identifiers that are unrecognized by your tooling can be searched for on
websites like <a href="http://www.oid-info.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> if your tooling does not already
do this for you.</p><p>Attributes contain one or more <em>values</em>, reflecting that some attributes of
real world attributes may have multiple values. A person may have multiple email
addresses, or an organization might have multiple mailing addresses, for
instance. Some attributes may be defined in such a way as to only permit a
single value, however; this is generally only used when it is known with
certainty that only a single value could ever apply, such as in the
<code>createTimestamp</code> attribute, which indicates the time at which a directory
entry was created.</p><p>As part of an attribute&#x27;s definition, an attribute may be defined to have a
specific syntax; for instance, the <code>telephoneNumber</code> attribute type is defined
to have a telephone number as its syntax. A user cannot insert a value of the
<code>telephoneNumber</code> attribute into a well-behaved directory server that is not a
valid telephone number. In addition, there may be rules specified for how values
of such an attribute type are to be compared, sorted, or searched (called
&quot;matching rules&quot;), as well as whether users are able to modify values of a given
attribute type or whether they should be managed by the directory server itself.</p><p>The attribute type definition can also indicate whether the attribute&#x27;s purpose
is to be used by the end user of the directory, making it a <em>user attribute</em>, or
whether the attribute is for the directory&#x27;s internal operation, which is called
an <em>operational attribute</em>. Yes, X.500 directories use entries and attributes to
manage their own configuration!</p><p>Attribute types may be defined to be <em>dummy</em> attributes, which are kind of like
&quot;aliases&quot; to one or more other attributes, or labeled as &quot;obsolete,&quot; preventing
them from being added to the directory any further.</p><p>An attribute type may be defined as a <em>subtype</em> of another. For instance, the
<code>mobileTelephoneNumber</code> attribute type is defined as a subtype of
<code>telephoneNumber</code>. This means that, if you query the X.500 directory for the
<code>telephoneNumber</code> of a person, the directory will return values of the
<code>telephoneNumber</code> attribute as well as the <code>mobileTelephoneNumber</code> attribute,
and any other subtypes of <code>telephoneNumber</code>, such as <code>workTelephoneNumber</code>,
unless you explicitly request for the directory to not do this. This also
applies to matching: searches in the directory for a entries with a given
<code>telephoneNumber</code> value will also return results for entries with a matching
<code>mobileTelephoneNumber</code> value, but not the reverse.</p><p>The attributes used to compose an entry are governed by the entry&#x27;s <em>object
classes</em>. Object classes specify what attributes an entry <em>must</em> have or <em>may</em>
have or both. Object classes are identified by an object identifier.</p><p>There are <em>structural object classes</em>, which immutably define what an
entry represents, such as a <code>person</code>, <code>organization</code>, or <code>device</code>. There are
also auxiliary object classes, such as <code>married</code>, which can be used to permit
further attributes in an entry, above and beyond the structural object classes,
such as <code>spouseName</code>, and which usually indicate some circumstantial data about
an entry, rather than something inherent to its definition; a <code>person</code> is always
a <code>person</code>, and can never become a <code>device</code>, but a person can become <code>married</code>
(and divorced, too!).</p><p>Like attribute types, object classes can be defined as subclasses of each other.
An <code>organizationalPerson</code> is defined as a subclass of <code>person</code>. The <code>person</code>
object class requires a <code>surname</code> attribute, but permits a <code>commonName</code>
attribute. As such, the <code>organizationalPerson</code> subclass does the same, but also
permits more attribute types, such as <code>telephoneNumber</code>.</p><p>There is a third type of object class, which is an <em>abstract object class</em>.
Abstract object classes cannot be used to govern entries exclusively: they may
only be used to define further subclasses, which may then be used. These are
rare, but you should know about them at least.</p><p>The most specific structural object class that defines an entry is refered to as
the entry&#x27;s <em>structural object class</em>. For instance, if an entry has the object
class <code>organizationalPerson</code>, it necessarily also has the object class <code>person</code>,
but its <em>structural object class</em> would be <code>organizationalPerson</code>, because
<code>organizationalPerson</code> is the most specific object class.</p><p>The object classes of an entry are stored in the <code>objectClass</code> attribute, which
has an object identifier of <code>2.5.4.0</code>. This is technically defined as a user
attribute for historical reasons, but it still functions like an operational
attribute.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="context-types">Context Types<a class="hash-link" href="#context-types" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Attribute values can be tagged with a sort of &quot;metadata&quot; called <em>contexts</em>.
Contexts are more general-purpose annotations for attribute values that are used
like so:</p><ul><li>To annotate strings with the language. For instance, if an organization has a
<code>description</code> attribute value in English and another value in German, the
English value can be tagged with a <code>languageContext</code> with a value that
identifies it as English, and likewise for the German description.</li><li>To indicate the time in which a value was/is true: by using a
<code>temporalContext</code>, a directory entry can indicate that Mrs. Jane Smith&#x27;s last
name was Doe up until July 25th, 2023, when she got married. This would be
done by having a <code>surname</code> attribute value of <code>Doe</code> using a <code>temporalContext</code>
indicating that this value is not applicable after July 25th, 2023, and
another value of <code>Smith</code> with no contexts. Instead of deleting old information
in the directory, it can be annotated with the &quot;validity time&quot; so that the
directory can be queried across time. This means that a directory can
function like a time-series database.</li><li>To indicate the applicable locale of a numeric unit, such as a currency.</li><li>To indicate a level of certainty associated with a value whose validity is
uncertain.</li><li>To annotate a value with a source of its information. For instance, if an
attribute value was sourced from a person&#x27;s birth certificate, this could be
indicated.</li><li>To annotate a value with a digital signature, providing data integrity at
rest.</li></ul><p>The type of context is identified by an object identifier. An attribute value
may have zero, one, or more contexts of a given type, and may have multiple
context types as well.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-directory-information-tree">The Directory Information Tree<a class="hash-link" href="#the-directory-information-tree" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The entries in a directory are arranged in a hierarchical structure, referred to
as the Directory Information Tree (DIT). In computer science, a &quot;tree&quot; is
conventionally thought of and spoken of as being upside-down. The &quot;root&quot; of the
tree is at the &quot;top,&quot; and there are branches beneath the root, leading down to
&quot;leaves&quot; that terminate branches of the tree. Leaves are at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the
tree, when using this terminology.</p><p>The root of the tree is a magical entry called the &quot;Root DSE,&quot; and it is not
technically an &quot;entry,&quot; but rather a special entry that is unique for every
directory server, and used to provide information about the directory server.</p><p>The entries immediately beneath the Root DSE are referred to as the &quot;top level&quot;
or &quot;first level.&quot; The first level contains real entries, which usually represent
countries, international organizations, or top-level domains. These have entries
beneath them, and those entries may have entries beneath them, recursively.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="names">Names<a class="hash-link" href="#names" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Directory entries are named using a selection of attribute values that are
called &quot;distinguished values,&quot; each of which are presented as an attribute type
object identifier and a value. This group of one or more distinguished values is
known as the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) of the entry.</p><p>There may only be, at most, one value from each attribute type within a relative
distinguished name. Only certain attribute types may be used in naming. As
implied, the relative distinguished name must come from attribute values that
are actually present in the entry: entries cannot &quot;distinguish&quot; values that they
do not have.</p><p>The following attribute types are commonly used for naming:</p><ul><li><code>countryName</code>, often abbreviated as <code>c</code></li><li><code>stateOrProvinceName</code>, often abbreviated as <code>st</code></li><li><code>localityName</code>, often abbreviated as <code>l</code></li><li><code>organizationName</code>, often abbreviated as <code>o</code></li><li><code>organizationalUnitName</code>, often abbreviated as <code>ou</code></li><li><code>commonName</code>, often abbreviated as <code>cn</code></li><li><code>givenName</code>, often abbreviated as <code>gn</code></li><li><code>surname</code>, often abbreviated as <code>sn</code></li><li><code>domainComponent</code>, often abbreviated as <code>dc</code></li><li><code>uid</code></li><li><code>title</code></li><li><code>dnQualifier</code></li></ul><p>For the purposes of displaying to humans, attribute types and values are often
represented as type-equals-value pairs (e.g. <code>cn=Jonathan Wilbur</code>). When
displaying whole relative distinguished names, the distinguished values are
joined with plus signs (<code>+</code>), after escaping any plus signs and backslashes
within the attribute values with backslashes (e.g. <code>gn=Jonathan+sn=Wilbur</code>).</p><p>Relative distinguished names are only expected to be unique among all entries
immediately subordinate to a given other entry.</p><p>The ordered sequence of relative distinguished names going from the top level
entry to the identified entry is refered to as the &quot;distinguished name.&quot; This
name uniquely and globally identifies an entry. When displayed textually, it
is the string-form relative distinguished names, joined by commas, semi-colons,
or forward slashes (e.g. <code>c=US,st=FL,l=Tampa,gn=Jonathan+sn=Wilbur</code>).</p><p>The Root DSE is an exception to the rules above. The Root DSE has a zero-length
distinguished name, and if needed, its relative distinguished name can be
represented as a zero-length relative distinguished name.</p><p>The attribute types that must be present or may be present in an entry&#x27;s
relative distinguished name is governed by a <em>name form</em>. A name form is a
schema construct that is enforced by the X.500 directory and uniquely identified
by an object identifier. Name forms target entries by their structural object
class, and there can be multiple name forms defined for a given structural
object class. Name forms are not expected to apply uniformly throughout the
Directory Information Tree; some regions of the tree can enforce different
naming conventions from others.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="schema">Schema<a class="hash-link" href="#schema" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In addition to the X.500 schema constructs mentioned above, further constructs
can constrain where entries can appear and what object classes, attributes, and
contexts they can have.</p><p>DIT Structure Rules are used to constrain what name forms (and hence, which
entries) may be present in a given location in the Directory Information Tree.
DIT Structure Rules are identified by a numeric identifier that is only unique
within a region of the DIT. DIT Structure Rules are recursively defined as
subordinates of other DIT Structure Rules. An example DIT Structure Rule might
constrain entries of structural object class <code>locality</code> to appear beneath
entries of structural object class <code>country</code>, since the reverse does not make
sense. The DIT Structure Rule that permitted an entry to be inserted where it
resides in the DIT is known as that entry&#x27;s <em>governing structure rule</em>.</p><p>DIT Content Rules circumscribe which auxiliary object classes, entries within
a region of the DIT may have, as well as what attribute types MUST, MAY, and
MUST NOT be present within entries that fall within the purview of the DIT
Content Rule.</p><p>Context Use Rules govern which contexts may be present in which attribute
values within a region of the DIT. Matching use rules are used to control which
matching combinations are defined for usage.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="matching-rules">Matching Rules<a class="hash-link" href="#matching-rules" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>X.500 directories use &quot;matching rules&quot; to define the logic of how two values are
to be compared, sorted, and searched, which are called equality matching rules,
ordering matching rules, and substring matching rules, respectively.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="compound-entries">Compound Entries<a class="hash-link" href="#compound-entries" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In many document-oriented databases, such as MongoDB, ElasticSearch, or CouchDB,
documents themselves can contain &quot;nested documents,&quot; and the directory is no
different in this regard: except these are called &quot;child entries&quot; and the
overall entry within which they are a substituent is called a &quot;compound entry.&quot;</p><p>Child entries are (almost) no different than any other entry in the directory:
they are just normal entries, except they have the <code>child</code> auxiliary object
class (<code>2.5.6.29</code>). An entry having this object class means &quot;I am really a part
of my immediate superior as a compound entry, rather than being a separate
entry.&quot;</p><p>Compound entries are useful for providing relational features to the directory.
For example, you can have a compound entries that represent people, and child
entries that represents computing devices they own. If you want to find
a person that resides in Florida <strong>and</strong> has a certain model of device, you
can use the &quot;family grouping&quot; feature of a search to obtain only these results,
rather than performing two separate searches for people and devices and
performing an inner join on the client-side.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hierarchical-groups">Hierarchical Groups<a class="hash-link" href="#hierarchical-groups" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Entries in the directory are arranged into a hierarchy, as established already.
However, sometimes there is a need for some other hierarchy that is independent
of the underlying directory structure. X.500 directories allow this via
&quot;hierarchical groups,&quot; which function like a &quot;virtual hierarchy&quot; on top of the
directory.</p><p>Hierarchical groups work very simply: each member in the virtual hierarchy has
an attribute <code>hierarchicalParent</code> that points to its superior in this virtual
hierarchy. There are other attributes that are supposed to be managed by the
directory automatically:</p><ul><li><code>hierarchyBelow</code> is a <code>BOOLEAN</code> that indicates whether a hierarchical group
member has subordinates in the virtual hierarchy.</li><li><code>hierarchyTop</code> points to the most superior entry in the virtual hierarchy.</li><li><code>hierarchyLevel</code> indicates how deep within the virtual hierarchy an entry
resides.</li></ul><p>These are only used in searches to provide relational capabilities across this
virtual hierarchy. For example, if the virtual hierarchy reflects the managerial
structure of an organization, you can query the directory for all managers of
employees that have poor performance reviews.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="collective-attributes">Collective Attributes<a class="hash-link" href="#collective-attributes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>As the directory grows, there might be a need to place the same attribute values
within entries over and over again, thereby wasting data storage space. For
example, in a small city that falls entirely within a single postal code, every
resident might have the exact same postal code (e.g. a &quot;ZIP code&quot; in the United
States). Instead of creating 100,000 copies of this value for 100,000 denizens,
the directory can store a collective variant of postal code that applies to
all denizens automatically.</p><p>Collective attributes are typically subtypes of some other non-collective
attribute type, so that assertions that match against the collective variant
match against the non-collective, and vice versa. As with other features we&#x27;ve
mentioned so far, this provides relational searches. Recycling the previous
example, you could search for all people with a certain name residing within a
certain postal code.</p><p>This may seem precarious in that a single exception to a collective attribute
assignment may necessitate abandoning the collective assignment of this
attribute, and individually assigning the attribute, making us no better off
than before, but the X.500 specifications have this scenario covered by allowing
entries to be marked as one-off exceptions via the <code>collectiveExclusions</code>
attribute. If 99,999 of our denizens live in a postal code, but a single person
lives in a different one, we can mark them as excluded from the applicability of
this collective attribute.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="usage">Usage<a class="hash-link" href="#usage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operations">Operations<a class="hash-link" href="#operations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Interactions with the directory use a request-response model. The types of
requests and responses supported by the directory are defined as &quot;operations.&quot;
As a simple example, &quot;operations&quot; for a padlock might be &quot;lock&quot; and &quot;unlock.&quot;
&quot;Operations&quot; for a video player might include &quot;play,&quot; &quot;pause,&quot; &quot;fast-forward,&quot;
etc. In a database, &quot;operations&quot; might include &quot;search,&quot; or &quot;insert.&quot;</p><p>The definition of an operation includes the syntax of the parameters for it
(the &quot;argument type&quot;), the parameters expected in the response (the &quot;result
type&quot;), and what types of errors might be returned by an operation. The errors
themselves specify what parameters they might include.</p><p>For example, an operation to read an entry from a directory takes the
distinguished name of the entry to read in the argument. The result includes
the entry if it exists and if the user is authorized. If the entry does not
exist, the user is not authorized, or some other issue makes it impossible or
undesirable to fulfill the request, an error may be returned, indicating the
nature of the problem.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rose-protocols-and-transport">ROSE Protocols and Transport<a class="hash-link" href="#rose-protocols-and-transport" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In the same way that a protocol stack such as TCP/IP encapsulates messages used
by the application layer and provides services such as in-order delivery, the
Remote Operation Service element (ROSE) is an abstract service that &quot;frames&quot;
messages to the directory to identify whether they are requests, results,
errors, rejections, etc., tags requests with a unique numeric identifier so
they can be cancelled or monitored, and tags requests with an identifier of the
operation type (such as a &quot;read&quot; or &quot;search&quot;). ROSE is, in other words, a
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism.</p><p>The abstract Remote Operation Service Element can be provided by the OSI
protocol stack via a protocol defined in the X.880-series of ITU-T
Recommendations, but it can also be provided over the &quot;Internet Directly-Mapped&quot;
(IDM) protocol defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.519 specifically for usage by
the directory, which runs over TCP/IP. There may be more implementations I do
not know about: it is defined as an abstract service so it can be provided in
many ways.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="binding-and-unbinding">Binding and Unbinding<a class="hash-link" href="#binding-and-unbinding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Before a Remote Operation Service Element (ROSE) can provide the Remote
Operations Service (ROS), the &quot;initiator&quot; between two correspondent endpoints
must &quot;bind.&quot; A bind is a special operation that performs any initial setup for
the ongoing ROS dialogue, which usually includes authentication, but could also
include version or feature negotiation. The bind operation has no invocation
identifier: there may only be one bind operation outstanding at a time.</p><p>When a ROS peer is done, they may (or must, depending on how you look at it),
unbind. Unbind basically just says &quot;I&#x27;m done,&quot; but it could also include a
reason why &quot;I&#x27;m done&quot; such as &quot;I&#x27;m done, because I am suffering from an
unrecoverable error.&quot;</p><p>Requests may not be sent after unbinding. After unbinding, the dialogue is
complete. However, the underlying transport may remain open, if desired; in
concrete terms, the TCP socket may still be kept alive and re-used for a
subsequent bind, perhaps to authenticate as a different user.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="authentication">Authentication<a class="hash-link" href="#authentication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>As we have established, authentication information is carried in the bind
operation.</p><p>There are five forms of authentication defined in the directory specifications:</p><ul><li><code>simple</code>: Authentication via a distinguished name (username) and password</li><li><code>strong</code>: Authentication via a cryptographic signature proving you possess a key</li><li><code>externalProcedure</code>: An authentication procedure identified by an object identifier</li><li><code>spkm</code>: Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM) described in IETF RFC 2025</li><li><code>sasl</code>: Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL), which is itself a
flexible encapsulation mechanism for many more authentication
exchanges.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dap-operations">The DAP Operations<a class="hash-link" href="#the-dap-operations" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The directory service is provided to users via the Directory Access Protocol
(DAP), which is a suite of 11 operations briefly described as such:</p><ul><li><code>read</code>: Read a single entry</li><li><code>compare</code>: Evaluate an assertion against an entry, returning whether it matches</li><li><code>abandon</code>: Abandon an ongoing operation</li><li><code>list</code>: List the entries immediately subordinate to an entry in the DIT</li><li><code>search</code>: Search for entries using a filter</li><li><code>addEntry</code>: Create a new entry</li><li><code>removeEntry</code>: Delete an entry</li><li><code>modifyEntry</code>: Modify an entry, such as by adding attributes</li><li><code>modifyDN</code>: Rename an entry, or move it and its descendants entirely</li><li><code>administerPassword</code>: Reset a password of an entry</li><li><code>changePassword</code>: Change a password of an entry</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="chaining">Chaining<a class="hash-link" href="#chaining" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The entire directory service can be (and is likely to be) split up among a
multitude of servers cooperating with each other. Sometimes, the right place for
a request to be fulfilled is not the server that originally received the
request. In other cases, the original recipient of the request may only be able
to partially satisfy the request, and may require more information from other
directory servers. To fulfill such requests, directory servers do what is called
&quot;chaining,&quot; which where they wrap your request in an envelope of sorts, send
this request to other servers saying &quot;this is the original request, and this is
what specifically I need from you to fulfill it.&quot; These secondary recipients
may, in turn, chain the request, recursively, meaning that a single request
could potentially propagate into a large number of chained messages.</p><p>The protocol that directories speak with each other to provide chaining, and
therefore the total satisfaction of requests, is called the Directory System
Protocol (DSP). The syntax for almost all of its operations are identical to
those of the Directory Access Protocol (DAP), except with a &quot;chaining arguments&quot;
envelope that encloses the analogous DAP request, result, or error.</p><p>In lieu of chaining, directory servers may simply return a referral, which
basically says &quot;here is the server to which you need to send your request.&quot;</p><p>Directory users may indicate that they prefer chaining or that they forbid
chaining entirely. They can also indicate that replicas of entries are
satisfactory--that master copies are not needed--and hence, the directory
should not chain requests to servers hosting the master copy if they themselves
have a non-master copy. (What an excellent segue to our next topic!)</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shadowing">Shadowing<a class="hash-link" href="#shadowing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The directory supports the replication of entries as read-only copies into
other directories for performance purposes (arguably security as well). This
replication is called &quot;shadowing.&quot; Directory servers that store read-only copies
or the &quot;master&quot; directory entries are said to &quot;shadow&quot; the &quot;master&quot; DSAs.</p><p>Shadowing improves the throughput of the directory because read-only operations,
such as searches, can be handled by an infinite number of replicas, and the
master can exclusively deal with modification operations, such as <code>addEntry</code>
or <code>modifyEntry</code>.</p><p>Shadowing is very flexible and can include all entries within a subtree of the
DIT or only a selection of said entries, and the replicated entries may receive
all of the attributes of the master copies, or just a selection of them.</p><p>Directory users can indicate that copies will suffice for their request. Copies
are often less authoritative than shadows, since they may contain stale or
out-of-date information, depending on how frequently updates to the master are
propagated to the shadows, but using copies is likely to speed up directory
operations.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="relaxation-or-tightening">Relaxation or Tightening<a class="hash-link" href="#relaxation-or-tightening" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Sometimes when you perform a search, you start with an idea of how many entries
you&#x27;d like to receive. The directory has a mechanism for altering search
criteria on the fly to target the requested number of entries. This is done via
&quot;relaxation&quot; which is where search criteria are altered to become less strict or
removed entirely to increase the number of results returned, or &quot;tightening&quot; in
which they become more restrictive to reduce the number of results returned.</p><p>There are two ways this is achieved: matching-rule substitution and
mapping-based matching.</p><p>In matching-rule substitution, the matching rules used
to compose the search filter are replaced with more or less restrictive
equivalents. For instance, a case-sensitive search could be replaced with a
case-insensitive search if too few results are matching.</p><p>In mapping-based matching, certain filter criteria are replaced with others
based on exterior data the directory has. One example of this would be a
map of postal codes to cities. If a search is not turning up enough results, the
directory can retry the request by replacing a filter selecting for a certain
city with a filter for all of the postal codes that intersect with the bounds of
the city and those neighboring them. In this sense, the directory would use its
geographic knowledge to search a broader area for matching entries.</p><p>In fact, the directory also allows users to control <em>how much broader</em> each
subsequent retry of the search is via an &quot;extended area&quot; parameter.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="signing">Signing<a class="hash-link" href="#signing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Directory requests, results, and errors may be cryptographically-signed to
provide non-repudiation and integrity. Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides
confidentiality and integrity in point-to-point traffic between a client and
server, but it does not protect a message that is passed along a chain of
servers. One of the servers in the chain could alter the message along the way
unless it is signed to prove its authenticity!</p><p>Even if a user does not sign his requests, he can still request that the DSA
sign its responses, including errors.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/Wildboar-Software/directory/edit/main/website/docs/deep-dive.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#executive-summary" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Executive Summary</a><ul><li><a href="#the-problem-it-solves" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Problem It Solves</a></li><li><a href="#the-future" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Future</a></li><li><a href="#other-executive-summaries" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Other Executive Summaries</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#users-deep-dive" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">User&#39;s Deep Dive</a><ul><li><a href="#object-identifiers" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Object Identifiers</a></li><li><a href="#information-model" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Information Model</a></li><li><a href="#usage" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Usage</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 Wildboar Software.
