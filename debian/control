Description: X.500 Directory Server (DSA) and LDAP Server by Wildboar Software.
 Meerkat DSA is an X.500 Directory System Agent (DSA) created by Wildboar
 Software, which includes full support for the Directory Access Protocol (DAP),
 Directory System Protocol (DSP), Directory Operational Binding Management
 Protocol (DOP), and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The X.500
